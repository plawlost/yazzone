I've noticed a pattern among founders I know: a disproportionate number were raised by parents who provided everything except the thing that mattered.

Food, shelter, school—all present. Encouragement, curiosity, emotional consistency—absent. These parents optimized for the wrong metric. They tracked inputs when the output that matters is unmeasurable: does your kid feel seen?

I call this Minimum Viable Parenting. Like a startup MVP, it's the earliest version that technically ships. It passes inspection. It is not something anyone would recommend.

## The Core Delusion

The MVP parent's core delusion is that provision equals parenting. It doesn't. Provision is a transaction. Parenting is a relationship. Confusing them is like confusing a landing page with a product.

You can tell MVP parents by their response when challenged. They don't engage with the substance. They pivot to accounting. "After everything I've done for you?" This reframes emotional needs as ingratitude. It's a shutdown dressed as a question.

"Other kids have it worse" is the escalation. By this logic, no one with food can be unhappy. By this logic, you should be quiet.

## The Selection Effect

The tech industry selects for MVP kids.

What the environment produces: self-reliance, because no one was coming to help. Extreme work ethic, because external validation was unreliable so you learned to generate your own momentum. Social fluency, because someone had to produce warmth and it wasn't going to be them. High tolerance for ambiguity, because you grew up navigating unpredictable emotional weather.

These are founder traits. They're also trauma responses. Same machinery, different framing.

I've built things. I'm sixteen and I've shipped products, talked to users, figured out distribution. When I examine why I'm able to do this—why I can sustain focus on hard problems without anyone telling me it's going to work—I trace it back to the same source. No one was going to believe in my projects for me. So I learned to believe in them myself.

This is useful. It's also expensive.

## The Cost

The cost shows up in specific ways.

You can't turn off the radar. MVP kids develop extremely sensitive threat detection—reading micro-expressions, tracking emotional weather, anticipating instability. Useful for navigating investors, employees, customers. Exhausting when there's no actual threat.

You can't receive help. Independence isn't a virtue when it's the only mode you have. I've caught myself refusing support I actually needed because accepting it felt dangerous. The logic, buried deep: depending on someone means they can disappear.

You can't stop producing. Rest feels like laziness because your worth was never unconditional. You were valuable when you were useful—filling silences, managing emotions, performing stability. The pattern persists: I'm still most comfortable when I'm building something.

You can't trust consistency. When early love was intermittent—warm one day, gone the next—you learn that good things don't last. So you don't relax into them. You're always waiting for the withdrawal.

## The Impossible Key

Research backs this up. Inconsistent parenting produces worse outcomes than consistently harsh parenting. Sounds wrong—surely some warmth beats none? But consistency allows adaptation. Inconsistency prevents it. You can build a model for cold. You can't build a model for random.

MVP kids develop a specific belief: I am the variable. If I were better, smarter, less needy, then the warmth would stabilize. This is wrong. But it's the only model that preserves agency. The alternative—love is random and I can't control it—is too destabilizing to accept.

So you spend years trying to find the key. You optimize yourself. You achieve things. The key never appears, because there was no key.

## The Counterintuitive Truth

My father had been in prison most of my life—political reasons. I saw him monthly through glass.

What that taught me: constraints force intention. When time is scarce, you can't defer presence to tomorrow. You either show up or you don't.

This generalizes. Founders with six months of runway often ship faster than those with three years. Students who work jobs often outperform those with unlimited study time. Scarcity clarifies. Abundance can obscure.

The lesson isn't about any one person. It's that presence is a choice, and unlimited availability can make it easy to keep choosing tomorrow.

## Two Kinds of Confidence

The MVP pattern explains something about founders. The ones with healthy backgrounds assume the world is basically fair, that effort correlates with outcomes. They're surprised when things don't work.

The MVP kids have a different confidence. They assume nothing. They don't expect the world to be fair. They've already survived conditions where effort didn't correlate with love, where the rules kept changing, where they had to generate their own belief from scratch.

This makes them resilient in ways that look irrational. They keep building when there's no external validation. They're comfortable with ambiguity. They don't need permission.

It also makes them bad at enjoying success. The machinery that enabled the climb doesn't know how to stop climbing. The threat detection that kept them safe doesn't know the war is over.

## What I've Figured Out

If you recognize this pattern:

Audit your fuel. Building to prove something to a parent who'll never see you is an infinite treadmill. Check whether your drive comes from genuine curiosity or from a wound that can't be closed. The first scales. The second depletes.

Turn down the radar. You're excellent at reading rooms. You're also running threat detection on situations that don't require it. The room will not collapse if you stop scanning.

Practice receiving. Your independence is a scar, not a virtue. Letting people help isn't weakness. It's a skill you never learned because the early help wasn't reliable.

Find the real key. You spent years trying to unlock consistent love from an inconsistent source. There was no key. That game is over. The new game is building things for reasons that are actually yours.

## The Right Question

MVP parents asked: what's the minimum I must do to avoid failure?

The right question is: what does this kid need to feel seen?

The first question produces compliance. The second produces a person.

Most MVP parents will never understand this. They'll keep pointing at the refrigerator. But at some point you stop waiting for them to ask the right questions. You stop being the emotional generator for a house that never generates anything back.

You just build. Not to prove anything. Because building is the thing you're good at now, and you might as well do it for reasons that are actually yours.

The best founders learned to believe in themselves because no one else was going to. The question is whether they can eventually let someone else believe in them too.
