# yazzone

Personal site at [yaz.zone](https://yaz.zone).

## Philosophy

Zero client-side JavaScript for theme switching. Dark mode respects `prefers-color-scheme` because your OS already knows what you want. No hydration tax, no flash of wrong theme, no localStorage hacks.

The whole thing is statically generated. Images are native `<img>` tags with proper `width`/`height` to prevent layout shift. CSS handles the tabs, dropdowns, and transitions. The browser is good at this stuff when you let it be.

~87kB first load. Could be smaller but I like fonts.

## Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router, static export)
- Tailwind CSS
- MDX for essays
- No analytics, no cookies, no tracking
