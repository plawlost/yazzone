# yazzone

This is the open-source code for my personal portfolio site, [yaz.zone](https://yaz.zone). 

I believe in building in public, so feel free to fork this repository, explore the code, and adapt it to create your own personal website. It's built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and designed to be easily customizable.
