I'm Yaz. I grew up in <WikipediaLink keyword="Ankara">Ankara</WikipediaLink>, half-<WikipediaLink keyword="Albanians">Albanian</WikipediaLink>, taught myself English and software, and skipped high school to build full time. Most of what I know came from open courses and documentation: <WikipediaLink keyword="CS50">Harvard CS</WikipediaLink>, <WikipediaLink keyword="MIT_OpenCourseWare">MIT lectures</WikipediaLink>, <WikipediaLink keyword="Y_Combinator">YC Startup School</WikipediaLink>, and a lot of debugging at 3 a.m. I like systems work, product architecture, and writing clearly about what I'm building.

At 14 I built Clade AI — a hardware-native assistant that ran off-device. We shipped prototypes, learned the hard problems of voice, <WikipediaLink keyword="Latency_(engineering)">latency</WikipediaLink>, and <WikipediaLink keyword="Inference">inference</WikipediaLink> at the edge, then shut it down when the team collapsed. Around the same time I became one of the first civilian testers of <WikipediaLink keyword="GPT-2">GPT-2</WikipediaLink> and <WikipediaLink keyword="DALL-E">DALL·E 1</WikipediaLink>, which pulled me deep into <WikipediaLink keyword="Generative_model">generative models</WikipediaLink> and human-machine interfaces.

That same year I gave a <WikipediaLink keyword="TED_(conference)">TED-Ed talk</WikipediaLink> on <WikipediaLink keyword="Information_privacy">data privacy</WikipediaLink>. Since then I've kept a steady rhythm of publishing essays that pressure-test ideas in public. I train, read, and ship. I prefer small, composable tools over platforms that try to do everything.

Today I'm the founder of Plaw Inc, building agent-native security and developer infrastructure. The computer now writes more code than humans can audit, so I'm focused on <WikipediaLink keyword="AI_sovereignty">AI sovereignty</WikipediaLink>, trust, <WikipediaLink keyword="Observability">observability</WikipediaLink>, and safe <WikipediaLink keyword="Autonomous_agent">autonomy</WikipediaLink>. I live mostly on the road, work remotely across <WikipediaLink keyword="Europe">Europe</WikipediaLink> and <WikipediaLink keyword="Asia">Asia</WikipediaLink>, and look for high-agency collaborators. If something matters, I build it, measure it, and keep what survives contact with reality.
